### 2.1 KNN

â€‹	hyperparameters: choices about the algorithm that we set rather than we learn.

#### How to set hyperparameters?

1. Split data into train, validation and test;
2. choose hyperparameters on val;
3. evaluate on test.

##### Also there's a method called 'Cross-Validation'

1. Split data into **folds**
2. try each fold as validation and average the results.

> It's useful for small datasets, but not used too frequently in deep learning.

### 2.2 Linear Classification
